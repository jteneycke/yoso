# "You Only Script Once" ðŸŽ©

## Description:
Instead of digging into the arcane incantations of bash or fish syntax,
just make a portable script that works across both, and lets you use
all the goodies that Ruby has to provide!

## Usage:
```
yoso SCRIPT_NAME
```

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/jteneycke/yoso.git ~/scripts
```

```
cd ~/scripts
./yoso
```
